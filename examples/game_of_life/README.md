The Python program 'game_of_life.py' uses MPI to simulate John Conway's Game of life in parallel. The state of the game board at each step of the simulation is saved to the 'results' directory.

Note: The number of MPI processes (ranks) must be a divisor of the 'num_points' variable (80 by default).
